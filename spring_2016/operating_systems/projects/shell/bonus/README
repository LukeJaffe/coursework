Features implemented:
1. All minimum requirements
2. Read characters individually as they are pressed
3. Left and right arrow keys navigate current input
4. Backspace works normally (but not delete)
5. Command history implemented
    -Up and down arrow keys navigate history

*NOTE
-Key code mappings are system dependent, so there may be issues
with some keystrokes, especially backspace

Also, this terminal is vulnerable to buffer overflow ;)
