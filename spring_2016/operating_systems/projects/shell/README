Directory "stable" contains a working version of the code.

Directory "bonus" contains a mostly working version of the code
with "history" ability implemented from up/down arrow keys. The
bug I encountered is incomprehensible... a char array is occasionally 
overwritten when the getchar() function is called. This must have 
something to do with the non-canonical setting I enabled. ncurses 
would have been easier...
